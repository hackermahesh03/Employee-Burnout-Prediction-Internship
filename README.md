# Employee Burnout Prediction using Machine Learning  

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on predicting employee burnout using machine learning techniques. It analyzes various employee attributes, cleans the data, and builds a Linear Regression model to estimate burnout levels.  

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Dataset  
The dataset includes employee-related attributes such as:  
- Date of Joining  
- Work Hours  
- Experience Level  
- Stress Indicators  

## Project Workflow  
1. Data Preprocessing – Cleaning the dataset by handling missing values and removing irrelevant columns.  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualizing data to identify trends and correlations.  
3. Model Development – Implementing Linear Regression to predict burnout levels.  
4. Evaluation – Measuring model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R² score.  

## Key Outcomes  
- Helps organizations identify employees who may be at risk of burnout.  
- Provides insights into potential work-life balance challenges.  
- Can be enhanced with more advanced machine learning models for better accuracy.  

## How to Run the Project  
1. Clone the repository:
